Within each folder, you'll discover a collection of workbooks, scripts, and reports that serve as concrete examples of my acquired skills and my systematic approach to problem-solving in data-related scenarios.




## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Technologies

During this intensive bootcamp, I developed proficiency in the following key areas:

*  **Python:** Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for robust data manipulation, in-depth analysis, and compelling visualization. I also gained experience in building automated data pipelines and interacting with APIs for data acquisition (including web scraping).
* **SQL:** Mastering the art of writing intricate SQL queries to efficiently extract, transform, and analyze data directly from databases, including advanced techniques like joins, aggregations, and subqueries. I also explored foundational data modeling and database management principles.
* **Excel:** Harnessing the power of advanced Excel functionalities, from complex formulas and dynamic pivot tables to insightful conditional formatting and the creation of impactful charts and graphs for data-driven reporting.
* **Power BI:** Designing and building interactive, user-friendly dashboards and comprehensive reports. This includes seamlessly connecting to diverse data sources, constructing effective data models, and implementing DAX for sophisticated calculations and business logic.
* **Tableau:** Crafting visually stunning and insightful dashboards and visualizations to effectively communicate data stories. I learned to connect to various data sources, create powerful calculated fields, and utilize filters and parameters to enhance user interactivity and exploration.
